								<p><strong>Graphic Designer</strong> is ranked second in terms of demand in 2018, and it would be suitable for most of us as the job requires much creativity. A graphic designer requires not only creativity, but the technical knowledge of design and art programs. Creativity ranks close to the top of the list, and is becoming an increasingly prominent skill as automation progresses and the simpler tasks can be left to AI. Software developers need to be able to problem solve, which is ranked as the second highest skill set on the list.<br />
									
<strong>Software Developer</strong> is near the middle of the list in terms of demand, below similar high-ranking jobs such as senior developer. We believe we can only attain that position, not only with good communication and leadership skills which we already have, but a lot of work as a software developer.Software developers are the ones who need more IT-specific skills, which may involve knowledge of one or more coding languages. More importantly, problem solving is an essential skill when coding, and encompasses the fundamental job of most developers. Software developers should prioritize learning languages at the top of the list, which include SQL, Javascript, and JAVA. These languages rank even higher than general skills, which proves their necessity in a software-developing environment.
<br />
	
<strong>UX Designer</strong> is ranked near the bottom, as it does not entail much technical skill, but rather requires the person to look at the game as a whole and make decisions to make user experience more enjoyable. User experience designers focus on a skillset of communication and good decision-making, as one must be able to picture how users would perceive the product and relay this thought to a team of developers. UX designers have a skillset that include communication skills, analytical skills, and leadership, the first of which ranks at the very top of the most demanded general skill of 2018. Although analytic skills and leadership rank in the middle of the list, they are still essential to a UX designer.
