									<h2>2D Game Design</h2>
									<p>We aim to develop a 2D, tile-based game where the character can move around and discover things in a fantasy world. Although we are not capable of creating great graphics or complicated game mechanics, we intend to have puzzles the player can solve and will work towards creating fundamental game mechanics.<br />
										We can begin this project by making the main character sprite that the player will control. Then we can create a 2D tiling system and import some basic ground textures to test whether or not the game can render properly. Most of the terrain textures will have to be seamless in order to create the illusion that the ground is one whole texture, rather than a repeating pattern of the same tile. Next we implement a camera that will follow our player wherever it moves, as well as code the function for players to move on an x-y coordinate axis. We have to make sure the velocity of the player movement is not too fast or slow, and then finish by binding some keys to the movement. Next, we plan to create a series of walking poses for my main sprite in order to animate the player character so it seems more lively. We can accomplish this by running through a loop of images depending on which way the character is moving. After this, we would like to work on some terrain and immovable objects, starting with walls and working my way up to more complicated terrain. Although this is a 2D game, we have to keep in mind that we are not working with a top-down view, but rather a side-view, so there will be some 3D elements that we will need to implement. For example, if the player walks behind a tree or wall, the game should know not to render the character; and if the player is in water, we can render half of the player and add a bobbing animation with water splashing to smooth out the cut of the sprite in the water. Once we have a general terrain completed, we can begin to work on interactable items and maybe an inventory. We could add item descriptions to give a bit of depth to the game. Then we can begin working on NPC's with randomly generated movement and dialogue options. By this point, we have created all the fundamental game mechanics and can begin writing a storyline and implementing different rooms for characters to roam and other rooms for puzzles. We want to create a similar game mechanic in OneShot, where items that are found can be used on puzzles and combined with other items to solve especially difficult ones. We can make the game feel more alive by adding dialogue for object interactions as well. The premise of the story will be that our main character wakes up in a trapped room of some sort and has no clue of how he got there. It feels like an overused trope but we think that it is a classic element of RPG adventure games that just make the transition from a black screen to gameplay more seamless. We think it is also a good way to let the user experience the game mechanics immediately, rather than going through tutorials.<br />

There are many platforms with which 2D games can be made, such as Unity, GameMaker Studio, and Eclipse. Each of these programs utilize different programming languages and every one has a varying level of difficulty. We have chosen GameMaker Studio as our game design platform, as it does not require any extensive coding knowledge and will allow us to become accustomed to the nature of game-making. GameMaker studio is comprised of a drag-and-drop environment with some reliance on its own developed language, GML, for creating physics. The graphics can be made on paint or Photoshop, as should only be 16-bit and not terribly difficult to design. We can also use royalty-free pixel graphics that are available online, which will allow us to focus more of our efforts on gameplay and mechanics.<br />

										The skills required for this project would be some fundamental level of game design and math. With our group members, it should be feasible to complete most of the fundamental game mechanics. However, some problems we may struggle with is implementing character physics and character interaction. Since some of us have basic knowledge of C++ and Java, we understand how much of a trial-and-error process it is when coding, and debugging issues will be one of our main obstacles.
